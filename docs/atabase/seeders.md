# Seeders

Seeders populate the database with initial or test data.

## Current Seeders
- None (Phase 1 does not require seeders)

## Future Seeders
- Admin user seeder
- Property master seeder
- Unit inventory seeder
- Commission rules seeder

## Best Practices
- Never seed production-only data in dev
- Use factories for bulk test data
