# Property Module (Phase 2)

The Property Module manages real-estate projects, towers, phases, and units.

## Features (Planned)
- Property master (project, tower, phase)
- Unit inventory (flat/plot/shop)
- Unit status flow (available → booked → sold)
- Property-wise analytics

## Business Rules
- Each property can have multiple towers/phases
- Each tower/phase contains multiple units
- Unit status must follow defined workflow

## Future Enhancements
- Document upload (brochures, layouts)
- Property categories (residential, commercial)
